 <h1><strong> My Service</strong></h1> 
 <p><i>As stated in my About section, I am an undergraduate student at
     Gondar University's College of Informatics. Consequently, I have 
     a basic understanding of programming languages such as HTML, CSS, 
     C++ and JavaScript. Therefore, I'm eager to provide advice on getting 
     started with web and app development. To conclude, I look forward to 
     helping you out whenever needed!
