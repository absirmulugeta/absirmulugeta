    <h1><strong>My School</strong></h1>
    <p>I completed my basic education in Zigite Balkole elementary school, 
        located in Arbaminch town within the Gamo zone of Southern Ethiopia. 
        Subsequently, I graduated from Arbaminch Secondary and Preparatory School 
        upon completing my secondary education at Zigit Bakole. Following a 
        successful completion of the Ethiopian National Exam, I obtained admission 
        to Gondar University to pursue higher studies.
